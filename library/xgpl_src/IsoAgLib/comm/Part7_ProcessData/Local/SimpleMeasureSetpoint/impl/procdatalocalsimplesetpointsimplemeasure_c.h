 * This file is part of the "IsoAgLib", an object oriented program library *
 * to serve as a software layer between application specific program and   *
 * communication protocol details. By providing simple function calls for  *
 * jobs like starting a measuring program for a process data value on a    *
 * remote ECU, the main program has not to deal with single CAN telegram   *
 * formatting. This way communication problems between ECU's which use     *
 * this library should be prevented.                                       *
 * Everybody and every company is invited to use this library to make a    *
 * working plug and play standard out of the printed protocol standard.    *
 *                                                                         *

  @brief Interface for managing of local process data object with restricted measurement
  and setpoint management ( %i.e. only one-shot measurement requests;
  set setpoint, without handling of acceptance, several concurring setpoint commanding ECUs ).

  Has __IsoAgLib::SimpleManageSetpointLocal_c / IsoAgLib::iSimpleManageSetpointLocal_c
  as member for doing setpoint and measurement specific jobs.
  \n
  Projects which use this class, must include the files and succeding subdirectories
  of the following subdirectories of xgpl_src/IsoAgLib/Process:
  - \e Local/SimpleSetpointElements and
  - \e impl
  \n
  Example:
  \code
  // define local device type
  IsoAgLib::iIsoName c_myIsoName( 1, 0 );
  // creation of process data instance
  iProcDataLocalSimpleSetpointSimpleMeasure_c c_workState;
  // init for LIS=0, local device type/subtype=1/0, complete work width=0xFF,
  // target process data/PRI=2, pointer to my local device type ( to resolve dynamic SA at time of cmd send ),
  // load/store measurememnt data to/from EEPROM
  c_workState.init( 0, 0, myIsoName, c_myIsoName, &c_myIsoName, false, 0x1234 );

  // update current measurement value ( real value, which can differ from commanded value )
  c_workState.setMasterMeasurementVal( 100 );
  // backend in IsoAgLib doesn't provide measurement programs ( only single one-shot value requests )

  // simply access received setpoints ( without facility to reject wrong values )
  int newVal = c_workState.setpointMasterVal();
  // set a different setpoint as the current "valid" setpoint
  // -> if other ECU requests current setpoint, it will recieve the new value as answer
  c_workState.setSetpointMasterVal( 100 );
